# LetsMakeAWebsite

This is our step by step tutorial on making your first website and hosting it for free using GitHub. There are 3 components to a client side web application - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tutorial leaves out the JavaScript. We'll add it in the future. 

# Some Definitions

## HTML
HTML is the structure of the webpage. 

## CSS
CSS is the style of the webpage. It uses the structure, laid out the HTML. 

## Let's start with our text editor

We recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/). It's made by Github, which you'll learn to love. 

You can use any other text editor, of course. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) is another good alternative. 

## 1. Now, let's make a file!

On Mac: Open a terminal prompt (spotlight -> "terminal"). Navigate to the directory of your choosing (cd ~/Github/), and write the command "touch index.html"

On Windows: You might be on your own for this one.

Just kidding! We love Windows :)

Create a folder named Github somewhere in your file structure. Then, right click and create a file named "index.html"

## 2. We've got a fancy file now! How about we fill it with some content?

First, let's open the file with your web browser and see what we find. Double click on the file, and it should open to show you.... nothing!

Now, let's make some cool web dev stuff.

Open the file with your text editor of choice (right click -> open with -> *insert your text editor*); a blank box with some numbers off to the side representing the number of lines of code. Go ahead and type your first three lines of code:

```
<html>
    Hello, World!
</html>
```

Save the file and press refresh in your web browser. You should see some simple text telling the world you exist. Cool, right?!?

Now let's make this place a little more friendly. How about a nice shade of blue?
